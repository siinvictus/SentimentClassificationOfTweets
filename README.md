# SentimentClassificationOfTweets
The aim of this report is to provide an approach in building a binary classification pipeline to predict the sentiments of a given Twitter dataset. In particular, we introduce six different preprocessing formats, including count vectorizer and tf-idf, and two pipelines, using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SDG) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB). The models are evaluated based on the F1 score and our best pipeline reached an F1 score of 0.846.
